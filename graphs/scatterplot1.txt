As we can see in the plot, the green dots represent hard tyres , which go upto 50  tyre life(in x axis) , which tells that 
hard tyres last longer , and even till 50 tyre life, while other tyres cant. It also goes upto only 100s laptime( which 
is very less compared to others), which means, drivers are able to drive faster using hard tyres, ofcourse, it also 
depends on drivrs using it , and other factors as well.
